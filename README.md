## Description

This is an application which allows you answer random true or false general knowledge questions from different categories and view a summary of your results.

## Motivation

I built this application to practice using TypeScript in React and to build a fun application.

### Available Scripts

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
